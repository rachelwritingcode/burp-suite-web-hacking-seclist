## Cyber Aegis Security List

- This is a custom security list made for the [Cyber Aegis Canada](https://cyber-aegis.ca/) Web Hacking Workshop.
- This security list demonstrates a brute force attack using Burp Suite's Intruder tool. 
- More details of this workshop are found in this [repo.](https://github.com/rachelwritingcode/Web-Hacking-And-Burp-Suite-Workshop)

### What is the objective of this workshop? 
- Teach learners about the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and learn how to use Burp Suite.
- Burp Suite is one of the popular tools using for bug bounty as well as penetration testing.

### Why are we doing this?
- I believe writing clean code is just as important as writing secure code. The OWASP juice shop was intentionally made to teach people about common vulnerabilities in web applications. 

### Where can I find the slides? 
- You can get a copy of the slides from this workshop [here!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SBCKRcQGZVdjvF8puu5WnH3cAULQwXIaBr0HiW_qaXI/edit?usp=sharing)
